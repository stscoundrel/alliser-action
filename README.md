# Alliser Action (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Run [Alliser](https://github.com/stscoundrel/alliser) using Github Actions.

## Why Alliser?

Alliser guards your project against incorrect file types. It an be something small -> maybe you want to enforce all files are .ts instead of .js. Or maybe you want to ban or discourage use of particular file extension, or a programming language.

Just setup Alliser Action, hook it up to pull requests and you'll know if some file extension is incorrect.
